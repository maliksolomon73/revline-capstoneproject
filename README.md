# revline-capstoneproject
Project Description: RevLine is a personal and community-based website designed for car enthusiasts to share stories and photos of their vehicles. The site’s goal is to create an interactive platform where users can showcase their cars, read about others’ builds, and connect through shared automotive interests.

Installation Instructions: Download or clone the project folder to your computer.

Ensure all files are in the same directory.

Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

No additional installation or software setup is required — the website runs locally in the browser.

Usage Instructions: From the Home Page, explore the site’s purpose and navigation links.

On the Stories Page, fill out the form to add your car’s story, including the make, model, description, and a photo upload.

Submitted stories appear in a table below the form with the user’s input and uploaded image.

Use the navigation bar to move between the Community and Support/About pages for more information.

The website is still being updated, with new features and visual improvements planned.
